# 4 Bit Binary Calculator 
Verilog HDL design codes for the following arithmetic circuits:

1) 4 bit Adder & Subtractor Circuit(Hierarchial modeling)
     It can perform addition and subtraction of two 4 bit binary numbers.
2) 4 bit Multiplication circuit
     It can give the product of two 4 bit binary numbers.
3) 4 bit Division circuit
     It can give the quotient and remainder when division in performed between two 4 bit binary numbers.
4) 4 bit Calculator
     It can perform addition,subtraction,multiplication and division operations between two 4 bit binary numbers.
     
Additional:

5) 3 bit majority function(Gate level description)
     It can identify if the number of 1's in the given 3 bit binary number are more or not.
6) 4 bit comparator(Data flow modeling)
     It can compare any two 4 bit binary numbers and decide the less than, greater than and equal comparisions between them.
